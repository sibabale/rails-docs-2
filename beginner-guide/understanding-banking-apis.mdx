# Understanding Banking APIs

If you're new to programming or banking technology, the term "API" might sound intimidating. Don't worry! By the end of this guide, you'll understand exactly how banking APIs work and why they're essential for modern financial systems.

## What is an API? (In Simple Terms)

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant:

**The Restaurant Analogy**
- **You (Customer)** want to order food
- **Waiter (API)** takes your order  
- **Kitchen (Bank System)** prepares your food
- **Waiter (API)** brings you the food
- **You (Customer)** receive what you ordered

**The Banking Reality**
- **Your App** wants to check account balance
- **Banking API** receives the request
- **Bank Database** looks up the balance
- **Banking API** returns the balance
- **Your App** displays "$1,247.83"

**API stands for "Application Programming Interface"** - it's simply a way for different computer programs to talk to each other safely and efficiently.

## Rails Public API Categories

### 1. Account Management APIs 🏦

**Public endpoints for**: Account creation, balance inquiries, and account information

```javascript
// Request account balance using Rails API
const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/accounts/12345/balance', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(`Balance: $${data.balance}`);
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "account_id": "12345",
  "balance": 1247.83,
  "available_balance": 1200.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "account_type": "checking",
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Transaction Processing APIs 💸

**Public endpoints for**: Money transfers, payments, and transaction history

```javascript
// Transfer funds using Rails API
const transferRequest = {
  from_account_id: "acc_alice_123",
  to_account_id: "acc_bob_456", 
  amount: 5000, // Amount in cents (e.g., $50.00)
  currency: "USD",
  description: "Birthday gift",
  idempotency_key: "unique-key-123"
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/transfers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(transferRequest)
});
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "transfer_id": "txf_789xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "from_account_id": "acc_alice_123",
  "to_account_id": "acc_bob_456",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z",
  "fee": 0
}
```

### 3. Customer Management APIs 👤

**Public endpoints for**: Customer onboarding, profile management, and authentication

```javascript
// Create a new customer using Rails API
const customerData = {
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  phone: "+1-555-0123",
  date_of_birth: "1990-01-15",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip_code: "90210"
  }
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/customers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-api-key'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(customerData)
});
```

**Customer Created Response:**
```json
{
  "customer_id": "cust_abc123",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe", 
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "kyc_status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:25:00Z"
}
```

## How Rails APIs Keep Your Money Safe

### 🔐 API Authentication
**Secure access using API keys and tokens**

```javascript
// Rails API authentication methods
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_live_key_abc123...',
  'X-Rails-Version': '2024-01-15',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

// For server-to-server calls
const serverHeaders = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_secret_key_xyz789...',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### 🛡️ Scope-Based Permissions
**Each API key has specific permissions**

```json
{
  "api_key": "rails_live_key_abc123",
  "scopes": [
    "accounts:read",
    "transfers:create",
    "customers:read",
    "webhooks:receive"
  ],
  "environment": "production",
  "rate_limit": "1000/hour"
}
```

### 🔒 Data Protection
**All data encrypted in transit and at rest**

```javascript
// Rails automatically handles encryption
// HTTPS required for all API calls
const apiUrl = 'https://api.rails.com/v1/accounts'; // Always HTTPS

// Sensitive data is never exposed in responses
{
  "account_id": "acc_safe_id_123",
  "masked_number": "****1234",
  "balance": 1500.00
}
```

## HTTP Methods Explained

**GET - Reading Information**
Like asking: "Can I see my account balance?"

```javascript
// GET requests retrieve data without changing anything
GET /api/accounts/123/balance

// Returns the current balance
{ "balance": 1247.83, "currency": "USD" }
```

**POST - Creating Something New**
Like saying: "I want to create a new savings account"

```javascript
// POST requests create new resources
POST /api/accounts
{
  "type": "savings",
  "initial_deposit": 100.00
}

// Returns the new account details
{ "account_id": "savings_789", "balance": 100.00 }
```

**PUT - Updating Information**
Like saying: "I want to change my phone number"

```javascript
// PUT requests update existing resources
PUT /api/users/123/profile
{
  "phone": "+1-555-9876"
}

// Returns confirmation of the update
{ "message": "Profile updated successfully" }
```

**DELETE - Removing Something**
Like saying: "I want to close this account"

```javascript
// DELETE requests remove resources
DELETE /api/accounts/456

// Returns confirmation
{ "message": "Account closed successfully" }
```

## Status Codes (How APIs Say "Success" or "Error")

- **200 - Success**: Everything worked perfectly!
- **400 - Bad Request**: Something was wrong with your request
- **401 - Unauthorized**: You need to log in first  
- **500 - Server Error**: Something broke on the bank's side

## Testing with Rails APIs

### Sandbox Environment
Rails provides a full sandbox for safe testing without real money:

```javascript
// Test account creation in sandbox
const testCustomer = {
  first_name: "Test",
  last_name: "User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  phone: "+1-555-TEST"
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.sandbox.rails.com/v1/customers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_sandbox_key_test123',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(testCustomer)
});

const customer = await response.json();
expect(customer.customer_id).toMatch(/^cust_test_/);
```

## Common Integration Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Security Mistakes**
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Always use HTTPS for API calls
- Store API keys securely (environment variables, key vaults)
- Regularly rotate API keys

**Rate Limiting Issues**
- Respect API rate limits (1000 requests/hour default)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use webhooks instead of polling for updates
- Cache responses when appropriate

**Error Handling Mistakes**
- Always check HTTP status codes
- Handle network timeouts gracefully
- Parse error responses properly
- Implement idempotency for critical operations

**Data Handling Issues**
- Never store sensitive data locally
- Always use amounts in cents (avoid decimals)
- Validate webhook signatures
- Log API interactions for debugging
